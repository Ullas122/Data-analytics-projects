# Project Title

Data Processing and Visualization from CSV to MySQL

## Description

This project involves the following steps:

1. **Data Extraction**: Importing data from 7 CSV files.
2. **Data Transformation**: Performing necessary data cleaning and transformations.
3. **Data Loading**: Loading the transformed data into a MySQL database.
4. **Establishing Relationships**: Setting up relationships between the tables in the MySQL database.
5. **Data Analysis**: Using Python to query data from MySQL and analyze it.
6. **Data Visualization**: Visualizing insights using the Matplotlib library.
7. **Business Questions**: Addressing 15 business questions through the analysis.

## Steps

### 1. Data Extraction

The project starts with importing data from 7 different CSV files. Each file contains raw data that needs to be cleaned and transformed before loading into the MySQL database.

### 2. Data Transformation

In this step, necessary changes and cleaning procedures are applied to the data to ensure it is in the correct format for loading into MySQL. This may include handling missing values, converting data types, and removing duplicates.

### 3. Data Loading

The cleaned and transformed data is then loaded into a MySQL database. Each CSV file corresponds to a table in the database. 

### 4. Establishing Relationships

Once the data is loaded into MySQL, relationships between different tables are established to form a relational database structure. This helps in efficiently querying and analyzing the data.

### 5. Data Analysis

Python is used to write SQL queries that extract data from the MySQL database. These queries are designed to answer specific business questions and provide insights into the data.

### 6. Data Visualization

The insights obtained from the SQL queries are visualized using the Matplotlib library. These visualizations help in understanding the data better and making informed business decisions.

### 7. Business Questions

The project addresses 15 specific business questions through the analysis and visualization of the data. These questions are designed to provide valuable insights and help in decision-making processes.
